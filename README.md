VideoClips creates video clip(shots) from an input video, where teh output clips are contiguous segments of the input video that represent a continuous scene or action taken from a single camera. That is, every time the camera viewpoint is changed abruptly, or the view from a single camera changes due to a significant change in time, a new clip should begin.

- The main file is VideoClips.m
- The clips folder contains the output from DickVanDyke.mp4
- The 3 distortion tools I made/used are Color Distance, Edge Distance, and intensity difference
